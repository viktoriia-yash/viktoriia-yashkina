                Hello! I am Viktoriia, an Italy-based 26 years old Ukrainian.
                Currently, I am working on becoming a web developer. Forced to
                live in two different countries - Italy and Ukraine.
              </p>
              <p>
                My interest in coding started thanks to Tumblr and peaked in
                high school. In 2014 I wanted to attend the university and link
                my life with programming, but I abandoned this decision due to
                many factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                It took me eight years to back to my dream. Throughout this
                time, I left one university after three years of study, earned a
                Bachelor's degree in sociology at another university, changed
                several jobs, and left my country because of war.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am on the way to achieving my dream now. I already took
                several online courses and gained basic front-end skills. I'm
                increasingly sure that coding is what I would like to do for the
                rest of my life. Now I am focused on learning SQL and MySQL.
